ru-findit
=========

All Ruby implementation of full text search engine.

Most full-text search engines are really heavy duty.  The goal of this is to write a simple one that can run quickly for
light tasks involving full text search.  Ideally, you might want to use this inside of a text mining project
if the rest of the project is in ruby.
